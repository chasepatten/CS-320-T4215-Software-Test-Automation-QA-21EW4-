**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
I can do this by a number of means but I would say one of the best ways I have learned from this course is to test early and test often. The more often you test throughout the development process, the easier it will be to meet the requirements that you need to. This will help lead to more functional and secure software.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
I do this by taking in all of the avaialable user input during the planning stages of development. By using all of the different resources of information that was hopefully aggregated during the intial phases should help to make sure I never forget about the users needs.

**How do I approach designing software?**
I try to approach it one step at a time. I find that I ge ttoo overhwelmed about the small things. SO, I take a step back and work on the program bit-by-bit. This has allowed me to slowly get better at creating functional software.
